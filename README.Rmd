This repository is a tryout to document my learning of R and use of git/github. 

As a veterinarian with no previous experience in writing code, R seemed a bit 'too much' when I started. As things went along I found more and more areas where it was useful to me.  This repository is created for my own documentation, to  keep things, tricks and ideas which took me quite a bit of time to find solutions to and that, in the end, made things work for me. It may not be the most elegant or correct way, IÂ´m sure, but it worked.   

What helped me starting learning R and git is:
* Learn the very basics. Anything and everything can be googled. Although, without the vocabulary that is a taxing task.
* Keep track of what you do. Keep a journal, use OneNote or a text document - anything to make you be able to retrace your learning steps.
* For R-projects - use Git - when you have messed up your code or want to collaborate on it, it is an invaluable tool.
* Collect useful resources. Nothing is as frustrating as knowing you watched a very good tutorial on youtube but not being able to find it again. Some sources I found useful:
  * Youtube: anything with Hadley Wickham or Jenny Bryan, but for the very start just search 'R tutorial basics'and see what you prefer!
  * Documentation for R-packages - the "help" is very useful - typing ?? followed by function name or help(function_name) will display the documentation.
  * The email list [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) 
  * The websites ["StackOverflow"](http://stackoverflow.com/) and ["DataCamp"](https://www.datacamp.com/)
  * 3 minute read on "Markdown"[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  * Once past the very beginning, the free online version of the book [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great help!
  * The podcast ["Dataframed"](https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast)
* Immerse yourself, but work at few elements at a time in the beginning. Find the tools you like and learn those. Trying to 'learn it all' is impossible, but reading and watching a lot of tutorials, and reading other peoples code in places like StackOverflow sure helps with getting the concepts. Personally, I use "R-Studio" and picked a suite of packages which fits my needs and show a similar syntax/organization to help me learn. Wickhams "tidyverse" with the addition of "knitr" and the use of markdown seems to cover my immediate needs.
* Last, but not least, try to adopt a decent style for writing code. It will help you learn by consistency and people will be able to read the code you wrote. A good source for this is the style guide in [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) The rest of the book is good too, but more of a later read.

Anyways, any resource be it written, video or talking to helpful people, all falls back on one thing - that you have the vocabulary and understand the very basics. The learning curve might be steep, but making the effort will pay off.
