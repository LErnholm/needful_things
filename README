This repository is a tryout to document my learning of R and use of git/github. Bear with me if I do stupid things - just trying to learn.

As a veterinarian with no previous experience in writing code, R seemed a bit 'too much' when I started. As things went along I found more and more areas where it was useful to me.  This repo is created for my own documentation, to  keep small tips and things which took me quite a bit of time to find solutions to and that made things work for me. It may not be the most elegant or correct way, IÂ´m sure, but it worked.   

What helped me starting learning R and git is:
* Learn the basics. Anything and everything can be googled, but without the vocabulary that is a taxing task.
* Keep track of what you do. A journal, OneNote or a text document - anything to make you be able to retrace your learning steps.  For R-projects - use Git.
* Collect useful resources. Nothing is as frustrating as knowing you watched a very good tutorial on youtube but not being able to find it again. Some sources I found useful:
  * Youtube. 
  * Documentatoin for R-packages - the "help" is very useful.
  * R-bloggers. 
  * The website "Stack Overflow".
* Immerse yourself, but work at few elements at a time in the beginning. Find the tools you like and learn those. Trying to 'learn it all' is impossible, but reading and watching a lot of tutorials sure helps with catching on with the concepts. Personally I picked a suite of packages which suits my needs and show a similar syntax/organization to help me learn. Wickhams "tidyverse" with the addition of "knitr" and the use of markdown seems to cover my immediate needs.
* Try to adopt a decent style for writing code. Will elp when collaborating and people will be able to read the code you wrote. 

Anyways, any resource be it written, video or talking to helpful people, all falls back on one thing - that you have the vocabulary and understand the very basics.
